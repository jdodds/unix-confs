;;; Commentary:

;; You'll need eproject, see <https://github.com/jrockway/eproject>.

;; After that, just (require 'qooxdoo) in your .emacs and you should be good to
;; go. By default, "generate.py source" will be run each time you save a file,
;; and there's a handy api lookup variable bound to C-c C-f.
